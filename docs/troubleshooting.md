### Unknown Product Dependencies

<img src="res/unknown_deps_err.png" width="600px">

If you encountered this issue, it's because there are some product dependencies that the tool failed to infer their packages. This case is likely to happen when having **local packages** that were not properly added to the project. Below is the instructions to resolve this issue (once only).

After seeing this error, you should see `__unknown__/<Product>` (ex. `__unknown__/DebugKit`) in the lockfile (xccache.lock).
```json
"EX.xcodeproj": {
  "packages": [
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "EX": [
      "__unknown__/DebugKit" // <-- HERE
    ]
  }
}
```
This mean, the tool cannot infer the package of `DebugKit`. So, what you need to do in this lockfile is:

(1) Specify the package of that unknown product.
```json
"EX.xcodeproj": {
  "packages": [
    {
      "path_from_root": "LocalPackages/core-utils" // <-- HERE
    }
  ]
}
```

(2) Then, replace the `__unknown__` in the dependencies by the package slug (ex. changing `__unknown__/DebugKit` to `core-utils/DebugKit`).

```json
"EX.xcodeproj": {
  "packages": [
    {
      "path_from_root": "LocalPackages/core-utils" // <-- HERE
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "EX": [
      "core-utils/DebugKit" // <-- HERE
    ]
  }
}
```

(3) After that, run the xccache workflow again.
