## üéØ Motivation
Caching frameworks is a popular technique to tackle project build time in many large-scale projects. A few outstanding tools in this category are cocoapods-binary-cache, Rugby, and XCRemoteCache. Rugby and cocoapods-binary-cache are particularly tailored for CocoaPods-based projects while XCRemoteCache works for a more general project structure. However, all three of them has the same limitation: **lacking support for SPM/Swift packages**.

This **xccache** tool attempts to bridge that gap.\
The long-term vision of this initiative is to make it a unified caching tool for iOS projects, including CocoaPods-based structures.
